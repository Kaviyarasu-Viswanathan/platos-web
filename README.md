### 1. Node.js offers easy scalability:
One of the key benefits offered by Nodejs is that it makes it easy for developers to scale the application in horizontal as well as vertical directions. The application can be scaled in a horizontal dimension by adding extra nodes to the current system.

Furthermore, Node.js also allows adding extra resources to the single node during the vertical scaling of the application. Hence, NodeJS is highly scalable and offers greater options than other JavaScript servers.

### 2. Full-stack JavaScript:
Node.js has regarded as a full-stack JavaScript for serving server-side applications as well as the client.

The benefit of using Nodejs is that you need not hire remote developers for front-end and back-end, which saves your valuable money and time.

### 3. Offer High Performance:
As mentioned earlier, Node.js interprets the JavaScript code through Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. The engine compiles JavaScript code directly into the machine code. Hence, it becomes easy to implement the code. Moreover, it can be done quickly and in an effective manner.

### $. Single Programming Language:
With Node.js it becomes possible for developers to write the server-side application in JavaScript. This means that when you Hire Nodejs developers they can write both front-end and back-end applications in JavaScript using a runtime environment.

### 5. Large and Active Community:
Node.js have a large and active community of developers who keep on contributing towards the further improvement and development of this server-side JavaScript.

Developers working on Node.js have supported well by JavaScript programmers who provide them with easy and ready-made solutions and codes in GitHub.

### 6. The ability of Caching:
The open-source runtime environment of the Node.js provides the ability to cache a single module. The entire request for the first modules gets cache in the application memory.

### 7. Support for Commonly Used Tools:
With Node.js, developers receive extend support for various commonly used tools. If you want to test the source code of Node.js application, you can do it by using Jasmin and other such testing tools.

Similarly, if you want to install or identify the project dependencies, you can make use of npm, which is a powerful package manager. 
### 8. Handles Requests Simultaneously:
Node.js provides the option of non-blocking I/O systems. It helps you to process several server requests simultaneously.

Node.js system can handle the concurrent requests better than Ruby or Python. The incoming requests get lined up and are addressing quickly and systematically.


### Disadvantages of using Node.js

### 1. API is not stable:
One of the key problems that developers encounter while working on Node.js is the Application Programming Interface keeps on changing in frequent intervals and does not remain stable.

At times, you will see a new API with multiple backward-incompatible changes. As a result, developers are oblige to make changes in the accessible code bases to remain in tune with the latest version of Node.js API.

### 2. Library Support System is not strong:
Compared to other languages, JavaScript does not have a robust and well-equipped library system.

As a result, users are force to take support from the commonly available library for executing tasks, such as processing and handling database operations, Object-Relational Mapping, XML parsing, etc.

This makes it difficult for developers to implement common programming tasks using Node.js.

### 3. Asynchronous Programming Model:
If you want to boost the scalability of the application, the requirement is that the application should adopt an asynchronous programming model.

However, developers find this model to be more difficult as compared to linear blocking I/O programming.

Another disadvantage of the asynchronous programming model is that the code becomes clumsy, and programmers need to depend on the nested calls.
